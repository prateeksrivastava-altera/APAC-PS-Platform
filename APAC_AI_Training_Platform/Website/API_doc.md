# 1. Authentication

To access the Matcha API, you need to authenticate using an API key. The API key should be included in the request headers as follows:

```
MATCHA-API-KEY: your_api_key_here
```

You can obtain your API key from the Matcha dashboard under the "API" menu. Make sure to keep your API key secure and do not share it publicly.

Example of a `curl` command with the API key:
        @keyframes fadeIn {
          from {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateY(10px);
          }
          to {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translateY(0);
          }
        }
      
```
curl https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/missions \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY"
```

# 2. Chat Completion API Endpoint

The Chat Completion API endpoint allows you to interact with the Matcha AI backend to generate responses based on user input. The responses from this endpoint should be very similar if not identical to the ones received from the Matcha chatbot.

The endpoint is as follows:

```
POST https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/completions
```

The request body should be in JSON format.

Example using `curl` command for a very simple chat completion against the globally available "Matcha's Self Serve Chat" mission:

**Request**
```
curl https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "mission_id": 424,
    "input": "How do I log in to Matcha?"
}'
```

**Response**
```
{
  "status": "success",
  "error": "",
  "output": [
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "### **SUMMARY**\nTo log in to Matcha, you’ll use your Harris credentials through the **“Sign in with Harris Account”** button on the Matcha login page.

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

The request body can be more complex, allowing for multiple messages in the conversation. Here is an example of a more complex request against a specific folder (Documents) within the globally available "Matcha's Self Serve Chat" mission:

**Request**
```
curl https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/completions \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{

    "context": "You are helping a new user answer questions about Matcha.",
    "chat_history": [
      {
        "role": "user",
            "content": "Can I make a workspace that contains missions that only I can see?"
        },
        {

                }
            ]
        }
    ],
    "messages": [
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "How about if I want to share with a small group of people?"
        }
    ]
}'
```

**Response**
```

  "error": "",
  "output": [

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "### **SUMMARY**\nYes—if you’re working in the **“Presentation Creation”** mission type, Matcha supports **sharing presentation access with specific other users**, which is a good fit for sharing with a small group. Access is controlled so that users will only see files they own or that have been explicitly shared with them.\n\n---\n\n### **DETAILED GUIDANCE**\n\n#### Sharing with a small group (what Matcha supports)\nBased on the features you listed, Matcha includes **Sharing and Collaboration** for **presentations**:\n\n- **Presentation access can be shared with other users in Matcha** (so you can choose a small set of people, rather than everyone).\n- Matcha uses **Row-Level Security (RLS)** for presentations, meaning **only the owner and users who have been granted access** should be able to view them.\n- In a **Presentation Creation** mission, the files/folders experience is designed to show **only**:\n  - files the user owns, or  \n  - files the user has been granted shared access to\n\n#### How this impacts what your small group will see\n- If you share a presentation with Users A, B, and C, then:\n  - **You** will see it because you own it.\n  - **A/B/C** will see it because it was shared with them.\n  - Everyone else should not see it (due to the presentations RLS policy).\n\n#### Quick clarifying questions (so I can point you correctly)\n1. Are you sharing a **“Presentation Creation”** mission/presentation, or a **“General Purpose”** mission?\n2. When you say “share,” do you mean **view-only access** or **co-edit/collaboration** access?\n3. Are the people you want to share with already **users inside Matcha**?\n\n> Sorry I couldn't find the exact step-by-step clicks (where the share button/menu lives) in the information you provided—only that sharing with other users is enabled for presentations.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY TAKEAWAYS**\n- **Small-group sharing is supported for presentations** (Presentation Creation mission type) by sharing access with specific Matcha users.\n- **Row-Level Security (RLS)** is used so only owners and explicitly shared users can access presentations.\n- In Presentation Creation missions, users will only see **owned or shared** files.\n- If you confirm whether this is **Presentation Creation vs General Purpose**, I can tailor guidance to your scenario.\n\n---\n\n### **MATCHA SUPPORT or FEATURE REQUESTS**\n> For more information, please contact the Matcha team at: [matcha@harriscomputer.com](mailto:matcha@harriscomputer.com)\n\n### **MATCHA Learning: Matcha Academy in Workday Learn**\n> Start your learning today at: [Matcha Academy: Foundations Level](https://wd3.myworkday.com/harriscomputer/learning/program/33708f05c648100153a195d8d5bc0000?type=2d29754fdb8e100008b50ff6bc94003b)\n"

## Full Completion Request Object Specification

**mission_id | folder_id | file_id** (integer, required): One of these three ids are required. This establishes the settings and scope for the chat completion llm to use.

**messages** (array, required if `input` is not used): A list of messages comprising your desired prompt. Depending on the model you use, different message types (modalities) are supported, like text, images, and documents (pdf, docx, etc.).

**input** (string, required if `messages` is not used): A single string input that will be used as the prompt.

**context** (string, optional): Any additional context you want to provide the LLM besides what already exists in the mission

**chat_history** (array, optional): An array of messages in the current conversation that will give the LLM context into your prompt.

**icl_folder_ids** (array, optional): An array of Matcha folder ids to include for the current mission.  This will force the base64 content of each file in those folders to be  included in the prompt. This is useful for including very specific  information that you want the LLM to use in its answers.

**stream** (boolean, optional): When set to true, the response will be streamed as it is generated by the LLM. This is useful for providing real-time feedback to the user instead of waiting for  the entire response to be generated. Default: `false`

This folder-level chat uses complete documents mode, excludes ICL folder examples, and only processes specific files 1001, 1002, and 1003 from folder 456. Note: `foldersToInclude` is not used in folder-level chat.

##### File-level Chat Example

**Request**
```
curl https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/completions \

      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "### **SUMMARY**\nThis file looks like a documentation excerpt for **Langflow’s Projects and Flows** user interface. It explains how to navigate back to the Projects page, create/manage flows inside projects, edit flow details, lock flows to prevent changes, and gives a high-level note on how flows are built and executed.\n\n---\n\n### **DETAILED GUIDANCE**\n\n#### **What the file is about (main topics)**\n1. **Managing flows in projects**\n   - The **Projects page** is the landing page when you launch Langflow.\n   - Projects act like folders to organize related flows.\n   - There is a default project called **Starter Project** where flows are stored unless you create a new project.\n   - You can create a project by clicking **Create new project**.\n   - The Projects page is also where you can manage your projects’ **MCP servers** (as mentioned in the text).\n\n2. **Navigating back to Projects**\n   - After editing a flow, to return to the Projects page:\n     - Click the **project name** or the **Langflow icon** in the Langflow header.\n\n3. **Editing flow details**\n   - Steps described:\n     1. On the **Projects** page, locate the flow you want to edit.\n     2. Click **More**, then select **Edit details**.\n     3. Edit the **Name** and **Description**, then click **Save**.\n\n4. **Locking a flow (preventing changes)**\n   - The file indicates you can lock a flow to prevent changes.\n   - Steps shown (note: the excerpt appears cut off/incomplete, but includes):\n     1. On the **Projects** page, locate the flow you want to lock.\n     2. Click **More**, then select **Edit details**.\n\n5. **Creating and running flows (high-level behavior)**\n   - Creating a flow involves connecting components via edges/ports with specific data types (example given: **message ports** send text strings).\n   - The build process:\n     - The graph build calls each component’s `def_build` function to validate/prepare nodes.\n     - The graph is processed in dependency order.\n     - Nodes are built/executed sequentially, and results pass to dependent nodes.\n   - Running/testing:\n     - Prototype flows can be tested in the **Playground**.\n     - For application development, it references triggering flows via the **Langflow API** and more advanced options (custom dependencies, containerization).\n\n#### **Why the text looks messy**\nThe repeated “CfCookie Preferences” and scattered headings suggest this was likely copied from a web page with UI elements (cookie banner text, navigation, or sidebar items) included.\n\n---\n\n### **KEY TAKEAWAYS**\n- The file is documentation about **Langflow Projects and Flows management**.\n- It explains **how to return to Projects**, **edit flow details**, and **lock flows**.\n- It includes a **high-level description** of how flows are built/executed (dependency order, sequential execution).\n- It mentions **ports/data types** when connecting components and using the **Playground** to test flows.\n- The content appears to be a **web-doc copy** with cookie/UI text mixed in.\n\n---\n\n### **MATCHA SUPPORT or FEATURE REQUESTS**\n> For more information, please contact the Matcha team at: [matcha@harriscomputer.com](mailto:matcha@harriscomputer.com)\n\n### **MATCHA Learning: Matcha Academy in Workday Learn**\n> Start your learning today at: [Matcha Academy: Foundations Level](https://wd3.myworkday.com/harriscomputer/learning/program/33708f05c648100153a195d8d5bc0000?type=2d29754fdb8e100008b50ff6bc94003b)\n\n\n![image](data:image/png;base64,...)"

# 3. LLM Passthrough APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic & Gemini)

Matcha provides passthrough endpoints that allow you to use standard OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google Gemini API formats while authenticating through your Matcha API key. These endpoints are useful for integrating with tools and libraries that already support these APIs, such as LangChain, LlamaIndex, or custom applications.

When using a mission-specific endpoint, the mission's system context will be automatically prepended to your messages.

## Available Endpoints

| Provider | Endpoint (without mission) | Endpoint (with mission) |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI | /rest/api/openai/v1/chat/completions/ | /rest/api/mission_[id]/openai/v1/chat/completions/ |
| Anthropic | /rest/api/anthropic/v1/messages/ | /rest/api/mission_[id]/anthropic/v1/messages/ |
| Gemini | /rest/api/gemini/v1beta/models/[model]:generateContent/rest/api/gemini/v1beta/models/[model]:streamGenerateContent | /rest/api/mission_[id]/gemini/v1beta/models/[model]:generateContent/rest/api/mission_[id]/gemini/v1beta/models/[model]:streamGenerateContent |

## Authentication

You can authenticate using your Matcha API key in any of the following ways:

- `OPENAI-API-KEY` header (for OpenAI endpoint)
- `ANTHROPIC-API-KEY` header (for Anthropic endpoint)
- `X-Goog-Api-Key` header (for Gemini endpoint)
- `X-API-KEY` header (works for all)
- `Authorization: Bearer [your_api_key]` header (standard Bearer token)

Unlike regular green tea, where the leaves are steeped and discarded, matcha involves grinding whole tea leaves into a fine, vibrant green powder.\n\nHere’s a quick overview:\n\n**Origin & Cultivation**\n- Originates from Japan.\n- Tea plants for matcha are shade-grown for weeks before harvest to increase chlorophyll, amino acids (especially L-theanine), and flavor.\n- Only the youngest, highest quality leaves are used.\n\n**Processing**\n- After harvesting, leaves are steamed, dried, and the stems and veins are removed.\n- The remaining leaf material is ground into a powder using stone mills.\n\n**Preparation**\n- The powder is whisked with hot water (not boiling) to create a frothy, rich beverage.\n- Used for \"ceremonial matcha\" (traditional Japanese tea ceremonies) and \"culinary matcha\" (added to lattes, smoothies, pastries, etc.).\n\n**Health Benefits**\n- High in antioxidants, especially catechins.\n- Contains caffeine and L-theanine for focused energy.\n\n**Taste**\n- Flavor is rich, grassy, slightly bitter, and sometimes sweet/umami, depending on quality.\n\n**In summary:**  \nMatcha is a uniquely prepared green tea powder with distinctive taste, vibrant color, and health benefits, enjoyed both as a traditional drink and in modern recipes.",

## Integration Examples

### Python with OpenAI SDK

        @keyframes fadeIn {
          from {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateY(10px);
          }
          to {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translateY(0);
          }
        }
      
```
from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI(
    api_key="your_matcha_api_key",
    base_url="https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/openai/v1/"
)

response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4.1",
    messages=[
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"}
    ]
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### JavaScript/Node.js

        @keyframes fadeIn {
          from {
            opacity: 0;
            transform: translateY(10px);
          }
          to {
            opacity: 1;
            transform: translateY(0);
          }
        }
      
```
const OpenAI = require('openai');

const client = new OpenAI({
  apiKey: process.env.MATCHA_API_KEY,
  baseURL: 'https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/openai/v1/'
});

async function main() {
  const completion = await client.chat.completions.create({
    model: 'gpt-4.1',
    messages: [{ role: 'user', content: 'Hello!' }],
  });

  console.log(completion.choices[0].message.content);
}

main();
```

## Request Parameters

**model** (string, required): The model to use for completion (e.g., 'gpt-4.1', 'gpt-3.5-turbo')

**messages** (array, required): Array of message objects with 'role' and 'content' fields. Roles can be 'system', 'user', 'assistant', or 'tool'.

**temperature** (number, optional): Sampling temperature between 0 and 2. Higher values make output more random. Default is 1.

**max_tokens** (integer, optional): Maximum number of tokens to generate in the completion.

**stream** (boolean, optional): If true, stream back partial progress as server-sent events. Default is false.

**tools** (array, optional): Array of tool/function definitions that the model can call. Supports OpenAI function calling format.

**tool_choice** (string | object, optional): Controls which (if any) tool is called. Can be 'none', 'auto', or specify a particular tool.

**top_p** (number, optional): Set how creative or predictable AI responses are. Lower values = focused answers; higher = more variety.

**frequency_penalty** (number, optional): Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their frequency. Default is 0.

**presence_penalty** (number, optional): Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on whether they appear in the text so far. Default is 0.

## OpenAI Notes

- Tool calls are buffered when streaming to ensure complete function call data is sent together
- Streaming responses include usage metadata in the final chunk
- All standard OpenAI API parameters are supported and passed through to Azure OpenAI

## Anthropic Request Parameters

**model** (string, required): The model to use (e.g., 'claude-sonnet-4', 'claude-haiku-4-5', 'claude-opus-4')

**messages** (array, required): Array of message objects with 'role' and 'content' fields. Roles can be 'user' or 'assistant'.

**max_tokens** (integer, required): Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

**system** (string, optional): System prompt to guide the assistant's behavior. Unlike OpenAI, this is a separate parameter, not part of messages.

**stream** (boolean, optional): If true, stream back partial progress as server-sent events. Default is false.

**thinking** (object, optional): Enable extended thinking. Object with 'type': 'enabled' and 'budget_tokens' for the thinking budget. Only for Claude Sonnet 4/Opus 4.

**temperature** (number, optional): Sampling temperature between 0 and 1. Higher values make output more random. Default is 1.

**top_p** (number, optional): Nucleus sampling parameter. Use either temperature or top_p, not both.

**top_k** (integer, optional): Only sample from the top K options for each token.

**tools** (array, optional): Array of tool definitions that the model can call. Uses Anthropic's tool format.

**tool_choice** (object, optional): Controls which tool is called. Can be 'auto', 'any', or specify a particular tool.

## Anthropic Notes

- System messages should use the `system` parameter, not the messages array
- Extended thinking is only available with Claude Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4
- Streaming uses event types (message_start, content_block_delta, etc.) rather than OpenAI's chunk format
- The `max_tokens` parameter is required for Anthropic, unlike OpenAI where it's optional
- All standard Anthropic API parameters are supported and passed through to Azure Anthropic

## Gemini Request Parameters

**model** (string, in url): The model to use (e.g., 'gemini-2.0-flash', 'gemini-pro'). Specified in the URL path, not the request body.

**contents** (string | array, required): The input content for the model. Can be a simple string (e.g., 'What is AI?') or a structured array of content objects with 'role' and 'parts' fields for multi-turn conversations. The structured format supports mixing text, images, and other content types.

**config** (object, optional): Configuration object with generation parameters. All parameters are optional.

### Core Generation Parameters

**config.temperature** (number, optional): Controls randomness. Range 0.0 to 2.0. Lower values make output more focused and deterministic.

**config.maxOutputTokens** (integer, optional): Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response.

**config.topP** (number, optional): Nucleus sampling parameter (0.0 to 1.0). Use either temperature or topP, not both.

**config.topK** (integer, optional): Top-k sampling parameter. Only sample from top k tokens.

**config.stopSequences** (array[string], optional): Array of strings that will stop generation when encountered.

**config.candidateCount** (integer, optional): Number of response variations to generate.

**config.presencePenalty** (number, optional): Penalize tokens that have already appeared. Range -2.0 to 2.0.

**config.frequencyPenalty** (number, optional): Penalize tokens based on their frequency. Range -2.0 to 2.0.

**config.seed** (integer, optional): Random seed for reproducible outputs.

### System & Response Format

**config.systemInstruction** (string, optional): System instruction to guide model behavior. For mission-specific endpoints, this is automatically populated from the mission's system context.

**config.responseMimeType** (string, optional): Output MIME type (e.g., 'application/json' for JSON responses).

**config.responseSchema** (object, optional): JSON schema to enforce structured output format when responseMimeType is 'application/json'.

### Advanced Features

**config.safetySettings** (array, optional): Array of safety setting objects to control content filtering.

**config.tools** (array, optional): Array of tool/function definitions for function calling.

**config.toolConfig** (object, optional): Configuration for tool/function execution behavior.

**config.responseLogprobs** (boolean, optional): Whether to return log probabilities for generated tokens.

**config.logprobs** (integer, optional): Number of top log probabilities to return per token.

## Gemini Notes

- The model name is specified in the URL path, not in the request body
- Use `:generateContent` for non-streaming and `:streamGenerateContent` for streaming responses
- Gemini uses a different message format than OpenAI/Anthropic - messages are in `contents` with `parts` arrays
- Streaming responses adapt to client requirements: SSE format `data: {...}\\n\\n` for direct SDK usage, or JSON array format `[{...}, {...}]` when `$alt=json` parameter is present (used by LangChain)
- System instructions can be passed via `config.systemInstruction` or automatically from mission context
- When using LangChain's `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI`, specify `transport="rest"` to use the HTTP/REST protocol. The default gRPC transport is not supported by this endpoint.

# 4. Generate Summary API Endpoint

The Generate Summary API endpoint allows you to interact with the Matcha AI backend to generate a summary or pull out specific information from the provided input. This endpoint is useful for summarizing large amounts of text or extracting key information from documents.

**Please note** that this endpoint does not use any content from files that have been uploaded to Matcha. This is purely a text summarization endpoint that uses the LLM to analyze only the input text you provide.

The endpoint is as follows:

```
POST https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/generate_summary
```

The request body should be in JSON format.

Example using `curl` command for a simple summary request against the globally available "Call Center Summary API (example)" mission. This mission has been configured to try and give reason why a utility customer might be calling. The answer is based on a block of text of information about the customer from a CIS system:

**Request**
```
curl https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/generate_summary \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "mission_id": "845",
    "input": "Customer status: inactive, Customer name: Tom, Balance: 102.34"
}'
```

**Response**
```
{
    "status": "success",
    "error": "",
    "output": [
        {
            "role": "assistant",
            "content": [
                {
                    "type": "output_text",
                    "text": "The customer is likely calling to inquire about or resolve an issue with their inactive account status."
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Full Summary Request Object Specification

**mission_id** (integer, required): The mission that will establish the settings and scope for the summarization llm to use.

**input** (string | json, required): A single string input that will be used as the prompt.

**context** (string, optional): Any additional context you want to provide the LLM besides what already exists in the mission

# 9. File CRUD Operations

The File CRUD API allows you to read, update, and delete files by ID. This enables you to manage file contents programmatically.

### Download/Read a File

```
GET https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/file/:file_idGET https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/download (legacy)
```

Download a file by its ID. The file will be returned as a binary download with the original filename. You can use either the path-based route (recommended) or the legacy query parameter route.

**Request (Path Parameter - Recommended)**
```
curl "https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/file/$FILE_ID" \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY" \
  -o downloaded_file.pdf
```

**Response**
```
Binary file download
(Original file with Content-Type based on file extension)
```

## Request Path Parameters

**file_id** (integer, required): The ID of the file to download (for path-based route).

## Request Query Parameters

Only used with the legacy /download endpoint.

**file_id** (integer, required): The ID of the file to download (for legacy query parameter route).

### Update File Contents

```
PUT https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/file/:file_id
```

Update or overwrite a file's contents by ID. The file will be re-analyzed and re-indexed. The Vector DB is updated using a gap-free approach: new embeddings are added first, then old ones are removed, ensuring no knowledge gaps during the update process.

**Note:** The file must be sent as multipart/form-data (binary upload). The `-F` flag in curl automatically handles this.

**Request**
```
curl -X PUT "https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/file/$FILE_ID?folder_id=$FOLDER_ID" \
  -F "file=@/path/to/file.pdf" \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY"
```

**Response**
```
{
  "status": "success",
  "error": "",
  "output": [
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": [
        {
          "type": "output_text",
          "text": "File 'example.pdf' (id: $FILE_ID) updated successfully. File will be re-analyzed and Vector DB will be updated without knowledge gap (new added before old removed)."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Request Path Parameters

**file_id** (integer, required): The ID of the file to update (specified in the URL path).

## Required Query Parameters

**folder_id** (integer, required): The ID of the folder that contains the file. This is required for verification to ensure the file belongs to the specified folder.

## Request Body (Multipart Form Data)

**file** (file (binary), required): The new file to upload. This will completely replace the existing file contents. Must be sent as multipart/form-data.

**File Requirements:**

- Maximum file size: 60 MB
- Allowed file types: PDF, DOC, DOCX, XLS, XLSX, PPTX, CSV, TXT, MD
- The original filename in the database will be preserved

**Important:** After updating a file, it will be automatically re-indexed. During this process, new embeddings are created and added to the Vector DB first, then old embeddings are removed. This ensures there's no gap where the file appears to have no content available for search.

### Delete a File

```
DELETE https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/file/:file_id
```

Delete a file by its ID. This will permanently remove the file and all associated data from Matcha.

**Request**
```
curl -X DELETE "https://matcha.harriscomputer.com/rest/api/v1/file/$FILE_ID?folder_id=$FOLDER_ID" \
  -H "MATCHA-API-KEY: $MATCHA_API_KEY"
```

**Response**

        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Request Path Parameters

**file_id** (integer, required): The ID of the file to delete (specified in the URL path).

## Required Query Parameters

**folder_id** (integer, required): The ID of the folder that contains the file. This is required for verification to ensure the file belongs to the specified folder.

**Warning:** This operation is permanent and cannot be undone. All file contents, embeddings, and associated data will be permanently deleted.
